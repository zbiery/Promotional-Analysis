# Promotional-Analysis

In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is utilized to find opportunities for increasing spending in grocery stores.
Specifically this project aims to answer the question "how can we increase revenue to frequent visitors but low spenders?" 
The data used is from the completejourney R library. The [completejourney (https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/completejourney/blob/master/README.md) package contains grocery store shopping transaction information from 2,469 households from 2016-2017.
